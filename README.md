## Inspiration
This project was written by me as part of the seminar data compression held during winter semester 2020/21 in Frankfurt.
A lot of the inspiration and the understanding comes from [Prof. Dr. Edmund Weitz](https://www.haw-hamburg.de/hochschule/beschaeftigte/detail/person/person/show/edmund-weitz/) who gave a [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fhHQgu2OcY) on the discrete cosine. He also developed a [similar (awesome) webseite](http://weitz.de/dct/), which was a huge help and inspiration for me.
